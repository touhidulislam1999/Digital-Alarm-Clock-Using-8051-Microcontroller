# Digital-Alarm-Clock-Using-8051-Microcontroller
The project focuses on creating a digital alarm clock using an 8051 microcontroller. The system includes an LCD, a keypad for user input, and a buzzer for alarm. The program uses assembly language to manage timekeeping and alarm functions, including setting alarm time, triggering audible alarms, and interfacing with hardware components.
